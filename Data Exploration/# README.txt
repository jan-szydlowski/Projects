# House Sales Analysis Program

## Project Steps
1. **Data Integration:** Program loads the King County housing dataset and prepares it for processing using the Pandas library.
2. **Feature Categorization:** Variables are manually assigned to numerical or categorical groups to ensure the correct statistical methods are applied.
3. **Statistical Profiling:** Program generates descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) to provide a overview of the market.
4. **Efficiency Analysis:** A custom metric is calculated to determine the price-to-living-space ratio.

## Libraries & Data Source
